# Umpire Tool

## Purpose

I'm a Delhi guy who loves cricket like many Indians, I've seen cricket Umpired counting ball on some device so I thought why not to implement on my first react app.

So I built it, while building it I learned many concepts and gets my AHAAA! moment on completing the whole working project.

*In the repository about section, you can have a link to that.*

One thing more, I also embedded the media queries, So, in the future, if I learned react native I probably building this app as a smartwatch app, So that I can gift this simple app to many of my known cricket umpires.

Technology Used:
- React
- CSS
